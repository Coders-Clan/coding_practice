  ## Arrays 
  
   An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.
   
   ### Creating arrays
   
   On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array. Additionally, you also need to specify the type of item that will be going into the Array.
